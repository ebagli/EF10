Numerical simulation of the isotope release from an ISOL target.
The method is based on the Monte Carlo code Geant4.
The code has been developed in the framework of the [SPES project](https://web.infn.it/spes).

The list of available commands for the input file and the description of the output file can be found on the [Project Wiki](

## 1. Introduction
Numerical simulation of the isotope release from an ISOL target.
The method is based on the Monte Carlo code Geant4.
The code has been developed in the framework of the [SPES project](https://web.infn.it/spes).

## 2. Usage
The list of available commands for the input file and the description of the output file can be found on the [Project Wiki](
